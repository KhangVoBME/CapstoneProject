# CapstoneProject
Main is the one we're gonna use for the final project. Its all the code together. It's incomplete so it wont compile until we do our main board.

The other files are for each component. All are compilable and tested. Some don't do anything and are just "hello world" code.

Not sure how git works, but if you make changes make sure theres a previous version we can access, in case something gets messed up. Final code will be pretty complicated.

Since its collaborative make sure to write detailed comments so we know whats happening.
